General question: 
Does the retail sales MoM evaluation every month incite predictable price movement in the short term?

Tests:
What percentage of months show a correct movement for the following hours after: 1hr
For each of the months that were correct above, what was the minimum, maximum and average pip movement for each?
Does the amount of absolute deviation from the forecast affect the likelihood of a correct price movement?
What percentage of months show a correct movement BUT following the opening of the London session? if starting before anyway...
Does the currency pair affect the likelihood of a correct price movement? --> [GBP_USD, GBP_JPY, EUR_GBP]
Does only taking trades with the supposed "trend" affect the likelihood of a correct price movement?
